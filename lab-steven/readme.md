# Lab 10 - Singly Linked Lists
This is a lab assignment in CF401 where we create a singly linked list object, and add different prototype methods to the SLL constructor.

### Setup
- Clone this repo
- Run ```npm install``` in your terminal (make sure you're at the lab-steven filepath in the repo)

### Methods
- ```new SLL()```            : creates a Singly linked list
- ```SLL.prepend(value)```   : prepends a new node as new Head of SLL with designated value
- ```SLL.append(vale)```     : appends a new node the end of SLL with designated value
- ```SLL.removeNode(node)``` : removes designated node from SLL
- ```SLL.reverse()```        : reverses order of SLL

### Scripts
- ```npm run lint```         : lints the code
- ```npm run test```         : runs tests (using mocha and chai, which are devDependencies)
