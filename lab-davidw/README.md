# lab 10 Single Linked Lists - Sorting
----
## Goal
 Write out methods for creating and sorting singly linked lists.  Prove they work with tests.
 - personal goal TDD

 ## Setup
 - You will will need node packet manager.
    - ``` npm init ```
    - ``` npm i -D mocha chai ```

## Usage
- the only relevant command is mocha:
```npm run test ```

## Expected
- You will see test output.  Three test cases, at least, for each method:
    - append
    - prepend
    - reverse
    - remove

### Attributions
I got stuck and took a look at Glen Pham's repository to compare my reverse and remove methods to another student's.  His was very similar, but I did note some differences which could have been bugs, and changed my code to be more like his.
